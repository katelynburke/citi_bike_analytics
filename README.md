## About Citi Bike:
Renting a Citi Bike is a fun, green, and easy way to travel around New York and New Jersey. Use a bike to commute to work, meet friends for lunch, or sight see around the city. Citi Bike is the nation's largest bike share program. It has 12,000 bikes and 750 stations across Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens and Jersey City. Using Citi Bike can also save you money. It is much more affordable than taking a Taxi or using the Subway. 


## Project Overview:
This project uses the visualization and analytics software Tableau. In this project, I aggregate the data found in the Citi Bike Trip History Logs to build a data story on Tableau to answer many pressing questions about Citi Bike. I also used Python Pandas and Jupyter Notebook to clean and merge the Citi Bike data sets. The Tableau story I have created, helps report interesting facts and data about the Citi Bike program during 2018 and 2019 in an engaging, understandable, and colorful way.

This project focuses on Citi Bike Trip Data from January - December 2018
